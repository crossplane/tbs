# TBS[11]: Cluster API

In this episode we are going to explore the Kubernetes [Cluster API
project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cl...) and how it can be used with
[Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane) to bootstrap new clusters
and provision workloads to them. Dan is joined on this episode by [Jason
DeTiberus](https://twitter.com/detiber), who is a maintainer of the Cluster API
project.
