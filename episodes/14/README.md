# TBS[14]: Open Policy Agent

Dan is joined this week by [Torin Sandall](https://twitter.com/sometorin), the
co-creator and maintainer of [Open Policy
Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). OPA allows you to write declarative,
context-aware policy for your cloud-native environments. Because OPA integrates
with Kubernetes, it can be used with Crossplane to set global policy on
provisioning cloud resources. We will take a look at how to write these
policies, as well as how to put them into action using both plain OPA and
[Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), OPA's native Kubernetes
integration.
