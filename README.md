# The Binding Status

The Binding Status is a show about [Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane), Kubernetes, and building an open multicloud future!

You can find all episodes on the [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL510POnNVaaYFuK-B_SIUrpIonCtLVOzT).
